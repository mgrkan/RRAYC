# RRAYC - Reddit Reader Autonomous Youtube Channel
## How it works:
First you need to have a Google Cloud account for Youtube Data Api. But you can also use Gcloud Wavenet TTS after you open an account just like i did. Once you have the credentials for the apis you can run main.py directly or youtubeDataApiSample.py to test it out. Don't do it in a server because it needs to create a token by going into authentication from your web browser. Once it created the token.pickle file you are good to go. Also for reddit stuff you need to have a reddit developer account and you should create a project. Then you should add your praw credentials to conf.py

**If you are willing to use this dont forget to brand it your own way from resources, change the logo etc.**
